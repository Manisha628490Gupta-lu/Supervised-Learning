TYPES OF SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHAM:
Supervised learning can be further divided into two types of problems:

 1 REGRESSION

Regression algorithms are used if there is a relationship between the input variable and the output variable. It is used for the prediction of continuous variables, such as Weather forecasting, Market Trends, etc. Below are some popular Regression algorithms which come under supervised learning:

* Linear Regression
* Regression Trees
* Non-Linear Regression
* Bayesian Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression

2 Classification

Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical, which means there are two classes such as Yes-No, Male-Female, True-false, etc.

* Spam Filtering,
* Random Forest
* Decisi  Trees
* Logistic Regression
* Support vector Machines

Advantages of Supervised learning:
# With the help of supervised learning, the model can predict the output on the basis of prior experiences.
# In supervised learning, we can have an exact idea about the classes of objects.
# Supervised learning model helps us to solve various real-world problems such as fraud detection, spam filtering, etc.

Disadvantages of supervised learning:
# Supervised learning models are not suitable for handling the complex tasks.
# Supervised learning cannot predict the correct output if the test data is different from the training dataset.
# Training required lots of computation times.
